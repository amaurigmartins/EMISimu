	abstract = {The insulation of the power transmission systems is exposed to stresses not only during normal operating but also by the transient overvoltages. Transient overvoltages are originated by different sources such as lightning, switching and faults. The switching surges have become dominant factor in the insulation design of Extra High Voltages and Ultra High Voltages systems. Insulation failure probability under transient surges is the main impressive concern in the studies of insulation coordination and failure risk. In this paper the failure risk of insulation under switching overvoltages generated during energization of unloaded transmission line are computed using the statistical approach. In the calculation, both the statistical characteristics of the overvoltages and statistical distribution of insulation flashover probabilities are tackled. The statistical distributions of energization overvoltages on a typical 500 kV transmission-line are derived from the results of 100 energization cases with statistical switching using Alternate Transient Program (ATP). The most important factors affecting the insulation flashover probabilities and the failure risk are demonstrated. The effects of number of towers in parallel, the switching overvoltages profile, the front time of the overvoltages waveform and the non-standard atmospheric conditions on the failure probability are investigated. Failure risk analysis is analyzed using different probability distribution schemes.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a transient-based algorithm for high-impedance fault identification on distribution networks. It uses the discrete wavelet transform to monitor high-and low-frequency voltage components at several points of the power system, being able to indicate the most likely area within which the disturbance has occurred, without requiring data synchronization nor the knowledge of feeder or load parameters. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through electromagnetic transients program simulations of high-impedance faults in a 13.8 kV system modeled from actual Brazilian distribution grid data. Solid faults, capacitor bank switching, and feeder energization are also simulated, considering the system with and without distributed generation. Obtained results show that the algorithm significantly reduces the search field of the high-impedance fault, reliably distinguishing it from other disturbances.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel approach for fault discovery of three-phase transmission line, which is primarily based upon the discrete wavelet transformation (DFT) and back propagation neural network algorithm. Three phase currents of most effective one end are measured, and discrete features are extracted using discrete wavelet transform. Those features are then used as inputs to the back propagation neural network algorithm. The training data set for back propagation neural network algorithm is obtained by way of simulating the ten extraordinary kinds of faults the use of diverse values of fault inception angles and fault resistances, so that the actual consequences may be received. The proposed back propagation neural network algorithm employs twenty inputs and best one output for classifying the faults. The distinctiveness of the proposed approach is that all the features, data used in developing the algorithm are normalized, so that the method may be used for any system with none significant changes. The simulation of the three-phase transmission line network and discrete wavelet transformation analysis are achieved inside the toolboxes of MATLAB{\textregistered}, and back propagation neural network algorithm codes also are written in MATLAB{\textregistered}.},

@article{Alexandru2020,
	abstract = {An important number of major utilities infrastructure projects are adopted worldwide as a consequence of human migration, pollution, geo-political alliances which force the governments around the world to massively invest in new transport and distribution networks serving for water, electricity, gas and oil supply. Installing pipelines in energy utility corridors containing high-voltage AC transmission lines subjects the pipelines to induced AC voltages, which is a real and serious problem requiring increased attention. Through proper modelling techniques, the induced currents and voltages in the underground/aboveground metallic pipelines can be accurately computed. In the following paper two different modelling concepts, based on circuit theory and electromagnetic theory approach are developed and discussed. A common right-of-way corridor between an overhead transmission line and a metallic pipeline is considered during the proposed assessment methodology. In order to evaluate how different variations of the model affects the magnitude of the induced quantities in the metallic pipeline a parametric analysis is employed. Based on the computed results, several dependencies between the power line current loads along with the considered length of parallel routing and the induced voltage are highlighted.},

abstract = {Among the available literature on electromagnetic interference between high voltage power lines and nearby pipelines, the topic of transient induced voltage on the pipelines are rarely discussed. Fault in high voltage transmission systems is usually cleared in several cycles, sometimes even before the fault current reaches the steady state. This paper proposes an analytical approach for calculating the transient induced voltage and current on a pipeline due to inductive coupling using a circuit model. A numerical example is studied to demonstrate the waveforms of transient induced voltage and current on the pipeline. Simulation results show that the transient peak of the induced voltage is greater than steady state values. Therefore, it is necessary to study the induced voltage and current during the transient period.},

A circuit model implementation based on the Alternative Transients Program (ATP) with frequency-dependent parameters is built to predict the transient inductive interference effects and ground currents caused by lightning surges. The model is validated using industry-standard software, and then leveraged to perform a detailed investigation of how lightning discharges with different characteristics and how distinct soil properties affect the propagation of the induced voltage wavefronts along the interfered pipeline. Results are expressed in terms of electromagnetic interference (EMI) zones within which the pipeline may be subjected to potentially hazardous voltages.},

@article{Christoforidis2003,
abstract = {The interference of power transmission lines to nearby pipelines and other metallic structures has been a research subject over the past 20 years. Especially during fault conditions, large currents and voltages are induced on the pipelines. Several methods have been proposed over the years and more recently one utilizing finite element calculations. The last method has the disadvantage that if it considers the pipeline to have a perfect coating, which is rarely the case as defects appear on the coating soon after the pipeline is buried in the ground. In this work a hybrid method employing finite element calculations along with Faraday's law and standard circuit analysis is discussed. The method is used in order to calculate the induced voltages and currents on a pipeline with defects, running in parallel to a faulted line and remote earth. Non-parallel exposures are converted to parallel ones and dealt with similarly. The defects are modeled as resistances, called leakage resistances. The fault is assumed to be a single earth-ground one and outside the exposure so that conductive interference is negligible. A sample case is analyzed and discussed. The results show that although the pipeline defects act in a way as to reduce the levels of induced voltages and currents, large currents can flow to earth through the defects that may damage the pipeline. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
