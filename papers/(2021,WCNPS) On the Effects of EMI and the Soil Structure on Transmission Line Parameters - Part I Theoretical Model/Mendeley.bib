abstract = {As the availability of powerful computer resources has grown over the last three decades, the art of computation of electromagnetic (EM) problems has also grown - exponentially. Despite this dramatic growth, however, the EM community lacked a comprehensive text on the computational techniques used to solve EM problems. The first edition of Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics filled that gap and became the reference of choice for thousands of engineers, researchers, and students. The Second Edition of this bestselling text reflects the continuing increase in awareness and use of numerical techniques and incorporates advances and refinements made in recent years. Most notable among these are the improvements made to the standard algorithm for the finite difference time domain (FDTD) method and treatment of absorbing boundary conditions in FDTD, finite element, and transmission-line-matrix methods. The author also added a chapter on the method of lines. Numerical Techniques in Electromagnetics continues to teach readers how to pose, numerically analyze, and solve EM problems, give them the ability to expand their problem-solving skills using a variety of methods, and prepare them for research in electromagnetism. Now the Second Edition goes even further toward providing a comprehensive resource that addresses all of the most useful computation methods for EM problems.},

abstract = {The problem of the rigid-piston radiator mounted in an infinite baffle has been studied widely for tutorial as well as for practical reasons. The resulting theory is commonly applied to model a loudspeaker in the audio-frequency range. A special function, the Struve function H1 (z), occurs in the expressions for the rigid-piston radiator. This Struve function is not readily available in programs such as Matlab or Mathcad, nor in computer languages such as FORTRAN and C. Therefore a simple and effective approximation of H1 (z) which is valid for all z is developed. Some examples of the application of the Struve function in acoustics are presented.},

Such representation is more accurate than the most common procedures of engineering practice and, in several conditions, lead to results with important differences.

One of the aspects covered in the paper is the importance of properly considering the Earth's electromagnetic behaviour when calculating transmission line parameters. Some comparisons are presented for an actual 440 kV three-phase transmission line in which the soil behaviour is represented through a unique real value of conductance (the normal approach) and through the proposed model.},

The pertinent equations for determining the excitation electric field along the cable are summarized, along with the expressions which relate the line current to the excitation field. These relationships for the cable current are seen to have the same form for both the transmission line and the scattering formulations. For the transmission line case, the cable current can be expressed in terms of per-unit- length impedance and admittance parameters which are functions of only the line geometry and the frequency. For the scattering case, similar line parameters can be inferred from the form of the solution for the current, but with the line parameters depending on the angles of incidence. Several numerical calculations of the line responses are provided, and these indicate that the transmission line analysis appears to provide response estimates which are smaller than those obtained using the more accurate scattering theory},

Simple algorithms and programs are developed for calculating grounding resistance using integral equation method. Examples and results related to the several different types of conductor division into segments (rings and sticks) are presented for grounding resistance and surface leakage current density. The straight rod is a 1m-length conductor with circular cross section 1 cm radius, deeply buried in soil conductivity 0.01 S/m. The accuracy of different segmentation types is compared with low frequency module of well-known CDEGS software.

@article{Das2014,
abstract = {A number of impedance-based fault location algorithms have been developed for estimating the distance to faults in a transmission network. Each algorithm has specific input data requirements and makes certain assumptions that may or may not hold true in a particular fault location scenario. Without a detailed understanding of the principle of each fault-locating method, choosing the most suitable fault location algorithm can be a challenging task. This paper, therefore, presents the theory of one-ended (simple reactance, Takagi, modified Takagi, Eriksson, and Novosel et al.) and two-ended (synchronized, unsynchronized, and current-only) impedance-based fault location algorithms and demonstrates their application in locating real-world faults. The theory details the formulation and input data requirement of each fault-locating algorithm and evaluates the sensitivity of each to the following error sources: 1) load; 2) remote infeed; 3) fault resistance; 4) mutual coupling; 5) inaccurate line impedances; 6) DC offset and CT saturation; 7) three-terminal lines; and 8) tapped radial lines. From the theoretical analysis and field data testing, the following criteria are recommended for choosing the most suitable fault-locating algorithm: 1) data availability and 2) fault location application scenario. Another objective of this paper is to assess what additional information can be gleaned from waveforms recorded by intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) during a fault. Actual fault event data captured in utility networks is exploited to gain valuable feedback about the transmission network upstream from the IED device, and estimate the value of fault resistance.},

A new method to directly obtain the partial derivatives of the earth apparent resistivities with respect to the earth parameters from the results of the complex image method is presented, which is more efficient than the conventional methods that arduously calculate the improper integrals with a Bessel's function and an infinite limit of integration.

Conventional methods of fitting the apparent resistivity curve in order to obtain those parameters do not give good results in all cases. This may happen when the soil has a multilayer structure and certain combinations of different layer resistivities exist. In this paper, an analysis of critical cases was carried out, and a novel calculation method for the parameters of the two-layer soil model is presented. The proposed method is valid for an arbitrary number of soil layers with arbitrary values of resistivity, and it is applicable to simple as well as complex grounding systems. The numerical results of this method were compared with electromagnetic field calculations carried out with a computer program based on the finite-element method. The proposed model permits the use of computer programs based on the method of images and a two-layer soil model for the design of station grounding systems buried in horizontal multilayer soil stratifications. Thus, the risk of serious calculation errors that may appear by application of the apparent resistivity fitting method can be avoided.},

Soil resistivity at each site was measured and interpreted to obtain equivalent two-layer and multilayer earth structures. It is shown that good agreement is obtained between the measured and computed values if multilayer earth structure models are used in the computations. Poor agreement results when uniform soil models are considered.},

abstract = {The interference of power transmission lines to nearby pipelines and other metallic structures has been a research subject over the past 20 years. Especially during fault conditions, large currents and voltages are induced on the pipelines. Several methods have been proposed over the years and more recently one utilizing finite element calculations. The last method has the disadvantage that if it considers the pipeline to have a perfect coating, which is rarely the case as defects appear on the coating soon after the pipeline is buried in the ground. In this work a hybrid method employing finite element calculations along with Faraday's law and standard circuit analysis is discussed. The method is used in order to calculate the induced voltages and currents on a pipeline with defects, running in parallel to a faulted line and remote earth. Non-parallel exposures are converted to parallel ones and dealt with similarly. The defects are modeled as resistances, called leakage resistances. The fault is assumed to be a single earth-ground one and outside the exposure so that conductive interference is negligible. A sample case is analyzed and discussed. The results show that although the pipeline defects act in a way as to reduce the levels of induced voltages and currents, large currents can flow to earth through the defects that may damage the pipeline. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Dalziel1968,
abstract = {Low-frequency electric currents of a few milliamperes flowing through the body cause muscular contractions. In the arm such an effect may make a subject unable to let go of a live conductor. The highest currents which 99.5 percent of men and 99.5 percent of women are able to let go have been shown to be 9 and 6 mA, respectively. Currents somewhat larger than this, in the range of 20 to 40 mA, passing across the chest may arrest respiration leading to asphyxia, unconsciousness, and even death. The most common cause of death in electric shock probably is ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the circulation is arrested and death ensues very rapidly. An analysis of available experimental data indicates that body weight and shock duration are important factors in determining the maximum current not likely to cause ventricular fibrillation. Taking a weight of 50 kg as the average for a human victim it is suggested that the relationship between current shock duration is given by I = 116/??7, where I is the current in milliamperes and T is the time in seconds. It must be stressed that this has only been shown to be valid within the range of 8 ms to 5 seconds. Currents flowing through the nerve centers controlling respiration may cause respiratory inhibition, which sometimes persists for a long time after the current has been interrupted. Other effects produced by high currents, such as burning, etc., are not discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {The interference caused by power transmission lines to buried gas pipelines is under investigation for many years. Situations where a pipeline is influenced by more than one power lines are more frequent nowadays, thus making the interaction more complex. Even under normal operating conditions, voltages and currents are induced on the pipeline that may pose danger to working personnel or may accelerate the corrosion of the pipeline's metal. In this paper, a case study taken from the Greek Transmission System is demonstrated. Measurements of the induced voltage at certain locations of a pipeline section are compared with theoretical calculations. These calculations comprise finite element computations and circuit analysis. Results presented show that the induced voltage on the pipeline is heavily influenced on the loading of each of the power lines, which must be known throughout the common route. For an accurate calculation of the induced parameters, it is recommended that the coupling between all conductors of the problem should be taken into consideration. Furthermore, theoretical calculations presented show the influence of the operation of installed over-voltage arresters, which connect the pipeline to mitigation grounding wires.},

As part of ESB International's power system earthing design work a catalogue of apparent earth resistivity measurements has been developed. The measurements have been used to calculate multi-layered earth resistivity models, which form the basis of country-wide topsoil and bedrock resistivity maps. Some analysis of the measurements has been carried out and in particular a more appropriate potential probe position for use in fall-of-potential measurements in Ireland has been calculated.},

@article{Christoforidis2003a,
abstract = {The interference of power transmission lines to nearby pipelines and other metallic structures has been a research subject over the past 20 years. Especially during fault conditions, large currents and voltages are induced on the pipelines. Several methods have been proposed over the years and more recently one utilizing finite element calculations. The last method has the disadvantage that if it considers the pipeline to have a perfect coating, which is rarely the case as defects appear on the coating soon after the pipeline is buried in the ground. In this work a hybrid method employing finite element calculations along with Faraday's law and standard circuit analysis is discussed. The method is used in order to calculate the induced voltages and currents on a pipeline with defects, running in parallel to a faulted line and remote earth. Non-parallel exposures are converted to parallel ones and dealt with similarly. The defects are modeled as resistances, called leakage resistances. The fault is assumed to be a single earth-ground one and outside the exposure so that conductive interference is negligible. A sample case is analyzed and discussed. The results show that although the pipeline defects act in a way as to reduce the levels of induced voltages and currents, large currents can flow to earth through the defects that may damage the pipeline. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Applying a series of parameter data to this expression enabled the preparation of r-a curves for such a multilayer structure, and these curves were compared with actual r-a curves obtained from two case studies. The results showed good agreement, indicating that the proposed expression and parameter estimation technique could be practically applied to ground design problems. In particular, earth parameters for a multilayer structure obtained through the proposed method can be used for calculating the ground resistance required by deep-driven rods in a particular geologic formation.},

The reason for this is the assumption of TEM-mode propagation in Pollaczek's formula as is well known. The fact suggests that nu- merical instability of the infinite integral is caused by incorrect integrand in a high-frequency region. Based on the observations, the applicable limit of Pollacezk's formula is analytically derived. Finally, a simple closed-form formula is developed, which approx- imates Pollaczek's formula with satisfactory accuracy},

@phdthesis{Gilbert2011,
abstract = {In every electrical installation, one of the most important aspects is adequate grounding; in particular, the grounding of high-voltage substations to protect people and equipment in the event of an electrical fault. Well-designed grounding systems ensure the performance of power systems and safety of personnel. It is desirable that the substation grounding provides a near zero resistance to remote earth. The prevailing practice of most utilities is to install a grid of horizontal ground electrodes (buried bare copper conductors) supplemented by a number of vertical ground rods connected to the grid, and by a number of equipment grounding mats and interconnecting cables. The grounding grid provides a common ground for the electrical equipment and for all metallic structures at the station. It also limits the surface potential gradient. Currently the IEEE 80-2000 standard for substations grounding [1] limits the determination of the grounding parameters (namely step, touch and ground potential rise) to that of a uniform soil model unless the Sunde graphical method is used. With the Sunde graphical method, it relies on interpretation to obtain a two layer soil model. Without the use of the graphical method, the IEEE 81-1983 [2] has several empirical equations that can be used for the two layer model; however, these equations rely on the use of images which retard the speed of calculations to the point where the overall optimization of the grounding grid (with respect to size and shape) has yet to be determined. The goal of the thesis was to improve upon the current restrictions for the grounding grid design, while minimizing the material (i.e., copper conductors) and installation costs of a grid. The first part of the research examined previous work through a combination of literature review, mathematical computations, and field measurements to validate the theoretical aspects of grid design. The thesis introduces an optimized uniform and two-layer soil with fast accurate calculations directly from soil measurements without the use of graphical methods or the use of complex image theory. Next, the thesis develops enhanced grounding parameter equations using Simpson's Rule of integration. The final part of the thesis demonstrates how it is possible to optimize the configuration of the grounding grid itself, minimizing costs, and yet still achieving a safe installation. This is the first time such an optimization is possible, and it is made possible by the techniques developed in this thesis. The techniques are applied to existing real-world grid designs, and the results obtained show the effectiveness of the method in reducing construction costs. This thesis shows how these construction and material savings are realized by utilizing a process whereby the grounding design minimizes the overall cost. The overall contribution of this thesis is the optimization of the grounding grid design by eliminating the current restrictions found in the IEEE standards 80 and 81, respectively, and offering an optimized grounding system design, starting from the soil model to the actual grounding design itself.},
