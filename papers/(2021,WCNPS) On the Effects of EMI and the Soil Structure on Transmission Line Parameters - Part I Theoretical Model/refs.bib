	abstract = {A number of impedance-based fault location algorithms have been developed for estimating the distance to faults in a transmission network. Each algorithm has specific input data requirements and makes certain assumptions that may or may not hold true in a particular fault location scenario. Without a detailed understanding of the principle of each fault-locating method, choosing the most suitable fault location algorithm can be a challenging task. This paper, therefore, presents the theory of one-ended (simple reactance, Takagi, modified Takagi, Eriksson, and Novosel et al.) and two-ended (synchronized, unsynchronized, and current-only) impedance-based fault location algorithms and demonstrates their application in locating real-world faults. The theory details the formulation and input data requirement of each fault-locating algorithm and evaluates the sensitivity of each to the following error sources: 1) load; 2) remote infeed; 3) fault resistance; 4) mutual coupling; 5) inaccurate line impedances; 6) DC offset and CT saturation; 7) three-terminal lines; and 8) tapped radial lines. From the theoretical analysis and field data testing, the following criteria are recommended for choosing the most suitable fault-locating algorithm: 1) data availability and 2) fault location application scenario. Another objective of this paper is to assess what additional information can be gleaned from waveforms recorded by intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) during a fault. Actual fault event data captured in utility networks is exploited to gain valuable feedback about the transmission network upstream from the IED device, and estimate the value of fault resistance.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates numerical instability issues in the mutual impedance formula between an overhead conductor and a buried conductor proposed by Pollaczek with special refer- ence to the integrand of Pollaczek's infinite integral. The integrand shows a negative real part and positive imaginary part at a high frequency, which result in negative resistance and inductance. The reason for this is the assumption of TEM-mode propagation in Pollaczek's formula as is well known. The fact suggests that nu- merical instability of the infinite integral is caused by incorrect integrand in a high-frequency region. Based on the observations, the applicable limit of Pollacezk's formula is analytically derived. Finally, a simple closed-form formula is developed, which approx- imates Pollaczek's formula with satisfactory accuracy},
