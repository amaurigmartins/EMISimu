Therefore there is a growing concern about possible hazards resulting from the influence of electrical systems : safety of people making contact with the pipeline, damage to the pipeline and to cathodic protection equipment. All these problems can be mastered but this control requires a serious consideration of the influences.},

abstract = {An important number of major utilities infrastructure projects are adopted worldwide as a consequence of human migration, pollution, geo-political alliances which force the governments around the world to massively invest in new transport and distribution networks serving for water, electricity, gas and oil supply. Installing pipelines in energy utility corridors containing high-voltage AC transmission lines subjects the pipelines to induced AC voltages, which is a real and serious problem requiring increased attention. Through proper modelling techniques, the induced currents and voltages in the underground/aboveground metallic pipelines can be accurately computed. In the following paper two different modelling concepts, based on circuit theory and electromagnetic theory approach are developed and discussed. A common right-of-way corridor between an overhead transmission line and a metallic pipeline is considered during the proposed assessment methodology. In order to evaluate how different variations of the model affects the magnitude of the induced quantities in the metallic pipeline a parametric analysis is employed. Based on the computed results, several dependencies between the power line current loads along with the considered length of parallel routing and the induced voltage are highlighted.},

We show how to process them all simultaneously and so exploit vectorization and the use of fast built-in functions and array operations that are so important to efficient computation in MATLAB. Using algebraic transformations we have made it just as easy for users to solve problems on infinite intervals and with moderate end point singularities as problems with finite intervals and smooth integrands. Piecewise-smooth integrands are handled effectively with breakpoints. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wu2017,
abstract = {Among the available literature on electromagnetic interference between high voltage power lines and nearby pipelines, the topic of transient induced voltage on the pipelines are rarely discussed. Fault in high voltage transmission systems is usually cleared in several cycles, sometimes even before the fault current reaches the steady state. This paper proposes an analytical approach for calculating the transient induced voltage and current on a pipeline due to inductive coupling using a circuit model. A numerical example is studied to demonstrate the waveforms of transient induced voltage and current on the pipeline. Simulation results show that the transient peak of the induced voltage is greater than steady state values. Therefore, it is necessary to study the induced voltage and current during the transient period.},

Based on the method of quasi-static complex images, the closed form of Green's function of a point source in both horizontal and vertical multilayer earth model is derived through matrix pencil (MP) approach. The fast convergent Galerkin's type of boundary element method (BEM) is taken to simulate and analyse a grounding system including floating electrode with any complicated structure, which can be located anywhere in horizontal or vertical multilayer earth model.},
